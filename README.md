You'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. Additionally, you'll need an [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or [XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for emulation. If none of the two work, you can use your browser for emulation, though it's not recommended.
